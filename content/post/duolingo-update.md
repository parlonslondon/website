You may have noticed that [our meeting](/page/reunion) is no longer listed on Duolingo. The meeting is still on, and everyone is welcome to join!

However our Zoom meeting link is unacceptable to Duolingo for some reason and it cannot be listed as the official online meeting link. This means that Duolingo members do not receive XP when they join the meeting. Some people have complained to Duolingo about this and their Event Manager has started forwarding the complaints to the member of our group who posts the meetings there. He has therefore removed the listing to avoid being harassed.

Our upcoming meeting will always be listed [at this link](/page/reunion) and you can keep in touch with us [in several other ways](/about). We will list the meetings on Duolingo in the future if possible, but I fully support the decision to remove the meetings for now.

I do want to stress that everyone who found us through Duolingo is *absolutely* still welcome to join! We love chatting with you all, and we're sorry if this change causes you any difficulties.
