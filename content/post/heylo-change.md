We are moving the group from Meetup to [Heylo](https://link.heylo.co/j7nz). Heylo offers us the same facilities that we currently use on Meetup but is simpler to use and much better value. Please join us there:

Our subscription to Meetup services expires on October 3, 2023. We have updated the Meetup group description to explain the change, and no further meeting changes or announcements will be made there. No change to the meeting times or location is planned at the moment so if you aren't able to join Heylo immediately then you can still attend at the usual time.

In theory, after expiry the Meetup group will continue to exist and anybody willing to pay will be able to take it over. We don't expect this to happen but should any of you wish to take it over and continue on Meetup then let us know.
