### Note For French Learners

When in-person this group is purely conversational. There are no lessons, no formal topics of conversation and no arranged activities, it's just a group of people who get together in the pub, except in French.

If you know even a little French (what you remember from school or a few Duolingo levels) but aren't yet
comfortable speaking you are welcome to attend just to listen and develop your "French ears". However,
definitely have a go at speaking or asking questions. Nobody will judge you. We've all been there! If you speak
French at an intermediate level or better it's a chance to brush up your skills. If you are a francophone it's a
chance to return to your native language. You are not expected to be a teacher or tutor but if you're able to
help beginners with questions occasionally then great!

In short: relax, be tolerant, and like everything else you get out of it what you put into it.
