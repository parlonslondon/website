We don't teach French - we are deliberately a casual group just for conversation - there are no formal lessons or homework and no preparation is required. However here are some helpful links that our members recommend:

## Learning

* [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) - a website and smartphone app that teachs French and many other languages gradually, for free (or without ads for an annual fee)
* [Memrise](https://www.memrise.com/) - a paid smartphone app that helps learn vocabulary
* 
* [Rosetta Stone](https://www.rosettastone.com/) - paid software with some similarities to Duolingo
